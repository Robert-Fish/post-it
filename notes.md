# Few Thoughts

Due to the size and time constraint of the test, there is some code that could be factored.
Due to alot of the components not being common across pages, they are not located in the components folder and unit tested seperately. With more time given it would be wise to refactor the jest config to reduce some of the duplication across the .spec files. I would have liked to have more coverage but ran out of time due to a bug in react-testing-library.
If time given, i would have liked to expand upon the mock responses to provide better written responses that are more flexible.

Thank you for your time, i really look forward to hearing back from you ðŸ˜„
